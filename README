NBATOPSHOT Script

How it works:

The script reads a list of links and players from an excel file and then using the chrome driver
to visit those links and checks the current lowest prices and compares against a price set in the 
excel sheet.

If the current price is lower than what's set on the excel sheet it will then send a text with the
players name, link, and current price. It will then also update the excel sheet by moving the links
where the price has been met to a different tab and keep iterating through the remaining list.

It takes about 2 seconds each link to give the browser time to load the page. You are also able to
run the browser headless if you like, I have which line to uncomment and comment out on the script.
After each iteration it waits 21 seconds before iterating through the list again.

How to use:
You will need to download chrome drive and specify the path of the chrome drive on line 40 of the script.
You will also need to specify the file path for the input.xlsx on line 62.

Then you will need a twilio account to receive text notifications for prices. Once you've created you twilio
account. You need to update the config.py with the api info from twilio and the number twilio provided and 
the number you would like to receive texts at.

From there just update the input.xlsx with the players name, links and price you would like the script to
compare the lowest current price against. Leave the 'output' tab blank as this gets updated whenever the current 
price of a link is met.

Once you have updated the things above you're ready to run the script!
